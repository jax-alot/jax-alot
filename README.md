- 👋 Hi, I’m @jax-alot
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to protect myself from account takeovers and create my own websites, possibly apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as I go...I was hacked & had most every single bit of my life taken over and I want to educate myself for my protection as well as for my own own personal reasons
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in particular email accounts, detecting & making apps, Facebook & messenger hacks
